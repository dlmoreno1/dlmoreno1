### 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Business Intelligence Analyst** with over 15 years of experience transforming raw data into actionable insights for decision-makers. I specialize in connecting the dots between business problems and data-driven solutions — bridging strategy, operations, and analytics.

Recently, I completed the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Bootcamp**, where I sharpened my technical skills with tools like **SQL**, **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and advanced **Excel** techniques. My training included hands-on projects where I built dashboards, performed deep analysis, and presented data stories that mimic real-world scenarios.

I’m passionate about **data storytelling**, process improvement, and using analytics to drive operational success. My goal is to continue growing as a data professional while helping teams make better, faster, and smarter decisions.
